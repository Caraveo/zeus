## 🚀 What is Zeus?

Zeus is the **ULTIMATE AI toolkit** for Mac users who are **TIRED** of:
- ❌ Being told "you need an NVIDIA GPU"
- ❌ Paying monthly subscriptions for cloud AI

**Zeus changes EVERYTHING.** One command. Full setup. God-mode inference. On YOUR machine. YOUR data. YOUR creativity.

### 💥 The Revolution Starts Here

Your M1/M2/M3/M4 Mac has a **BEAST** GPU inside. Most AI tools ignore it. Zeus **UNLEASHES** it.
